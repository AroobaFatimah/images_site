i want that each user has its own collection page
i want that when a user is logged in, and clicks to add image to collection for 1st time then image should be added to the collection page of that person
That persons email and his added images should be added to the collections as an object
If the person is already in collections and add a new image to his collection then only update his collection images in the collections array.
