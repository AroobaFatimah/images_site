Problems in search functionality:
its not searching properly, when the tag is searched it works when the tag is changed
it dont allow to erase the whole search keyword --- done
Need to assign proper tags for each image

Problems in home pages images grid:
As i implemented the open modal functionality on clicking an image, the buttons on the images got disturbed --- resolved
I want that when the buttons on the images are clicked, only that button functionality should be executed. It should not open modal. --- done
But when it is clicked anywhere on the card except the buttons, the modal should open --- done

Problems in downloading image at different sizes:
The image is downloading only in one size
I want to download image in different sizes

Problems in collection page:
The should be a banner in the collection page
The images card on the collection page also contains buttons. It should only contain delete or download buttons
And on clicking the image, there should be same process as for home page (open Modal)

In header:
There should be home button to navigate back to home page from the collection page

Need to refactor code:
The code is very messy
Need to create proper components like button, input field, li extra
